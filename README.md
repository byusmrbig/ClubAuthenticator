# ClubAuthenticator
A code set that can be used at club events, in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi and a remote MySQL table, to see if a club member has paid dues and accepted club agreements based on a swipe of their ID card.

The code current lacks proper RGB LED functionality. Future plans for the project include moving away from the use of local text files, and instead use a remote MySQL database to obtain a list of full members, members who need to sign a club agreement, and people who need to pay dues.
